# What is Model Context Protocol?

Model Context Protocol (MCP) is an open standard designed to facilitate interoperability between AI models, tools, and applications. It defines a common way for systems to exchange context, metadata, and instructions, making it easier to integrate and orchestrate AI workflows across different platforms and technologies.

## Why Do We Need Model Context Protocol?

- **Interoperability:** MCP enables different AI models and tools to communicate seamlessly, regardless of vendor or framework.
- **Scalability:** By standardizing context exchange, MCP allows organizations to scale their AI solutions without being locked into a single ecosystem.
- **Flexibility:** Developers can mix and match models, tools, and services, accelerating innovation and reducing integration effort.
- **Transparency:** MCP provides a clear structure for passing context, improving traceability and debugging in complex AI pipelines.

## How to Use Model Context Protocol

1. **Define Context:** Structure the context information (such as user input, environment variables, or task instructions) according to MCP specifications.
2. **Integrate MCP Libraries:** Use available MCP libraries or SDKs in your application to format and transmit context data.
3. **Connect Models and Tools:** Ensure that your models and tools support MCP, allowing them to receive and act on context information.
4. **Orchestrate Workflows:** Build AI workflows that leverage MCP to pass context between components, enabling dynamic and adaptive behavior.

### Example Usage

```python
from mcp import ModelContext

context = ModelContext(user_id="123", task="summarization", language="en")
model_output = ai_model.run(context)
```
